Motivation: It's important to be able to quickly make predictions about things that
matter in academics like awards, which could impact tenure. We could also imagine
trying to predict a PhD student's productivity, etc.

One of the big problems with building a model is collecting data and no such easily
available dataset exists in this field. Therefore, having an application that has useful data
on people already would be very valuable.

The next issue is that modeling is a specific skill that requires some expertise.
It's nice to have an automated system that builds models based on predictors in a
sensible fashion.

Our goal is to build a plug-and-play system where administrators can add their own
proprietary data and combine it with the publicly available datasets already
pre-loaded in the app in order to make predictions.
